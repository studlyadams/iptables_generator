# iptables_generator
Python Practice: script to automate the generation of IPtables v4/6 

Note as of 2019:
I was working on creating a wrapper for IPTables as a sort fo practice concept with Python. 

I didn't get very far with this one, I'll most likely return to it at some point in the future. Maybe even move it over to
Golang.
